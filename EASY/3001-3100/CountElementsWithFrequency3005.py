# You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.

# Return the total frequencies of elements in nums such that those elements all have the maximum frequency.

# The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.
# So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.
# So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.
